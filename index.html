                Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. With practice comes confidence.

                Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it.
                
                Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. We'll play with clouds today.
                
                When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend.
